        "## About PEFT\n",
        "PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models like transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT, etc.) for specific tasks. The primary goal of PEFT is to reduce the number of parameters that need to be updated during the fine-tuning process, which significantly decreases the computational cost and memory usage while maintaining or even improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts of PEFT:\n",
        "Efficiency: By focusing only on a subset of parameters, PEFT avoids the need to fine-tune all parameters of the model, making the process faster and less resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory and Computational Savings: PEFT drastically reduces the amount of GPU memory required, making it feasible to fine-tune very large models on smaller hardware setups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance Maintenance: Despite fine-tuning fewer parameters, PEFT techniques are often able to achieve comparable or even superior performance to full fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Application Areas: PEFT is widely used in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other AI tasks that involve large-scale models, allowing for efficient adaptation of general-purpose models to specific applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Techniques Used in PEFT:\n",
        "Adapters: Small neural network modules inserted into the layers of a pre-trained model that learn task-specific information without altering the main model weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): A method that fine-tunes low-rank updates to the model weights, reducing the number of parameters that need to be trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prefix Tuning: Adds task-specific vectors (prefixes) to the input sequence that influence the model output, thus adapting the model without changing its core parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "BitFit (Bias-Only Fine-Tuning): Fine-tunes only the bias terms of the model, leaving the majority of the weights untouched.\n",

Breitbart News contacted the Crookston Police Department and asked whether Ayanle spoke English, whether he arrived under the federal refugee resettlement program or a different immigration program, and for details on his current visa status, but did not receive a response.Breitbart News also contacted Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Lutheran Social Services, two of the largest resettlement agencies based in Minnesota, and asked if either had helped to resettle Ayanle, but did not receive a response. A sexual assault evidence kit was collected at RiverView Health and the Polk County Sheriff s Office is assisting in the continued investigation,  the Times added.Crookston, a city of 7,800 with a 15 person police force, is located 25 miles southeast of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Breitbart News\",\n          \" (This March 22 story was corrected to remove reference to Inhofe being chairman in paragraph four) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee easily passed a bill on Wednesday to enable the nuclear regulator to license advanced nuclear reactors that backers say are safer than conventional plants and can help deal with a growing waste problem. The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a regulatory framework to enable the licensing of advanced nuclear reactors that could come into development in 10 or 15 years.   The bill passed 18-3 in the Environment and Public Works Committee.  Republican Senator James Inhofe, said the bill is \\u201ccritical for the revitalization and improvement of our nation\\u2019s nuclear energy industry.\\u201d  The bill has brought together some Republicans eager to prevent the United States from falling behind China and Russia in nuclear innovation and Democrats who want to foster technologies that do not emit gases blamed for climate change. But the legislation faces a cloudy future.  The nuclear industry faces competition from cheap natural gas prices and the growing wind and solar power industries. It was uncertain whether the full Senate would debate the bill or if the measure would be absorbed into broader energy legislation. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the bill would help the United States keep its lead in innovation while finding possible solutions to the waste now kept in pools and in casks at conventional nuclear plant sites.    \\u201cIf we can get there, we will have done this country and the world a vital public service,\\u201d Whitehouse said of the potential for the advanced reactors to reduce the waste problem.  A fellow Democrat, Senator Kamala Harris of California - one of several lawmakers who want to see the country find comprehensive, permanent solutions to existing nuclear waste from conventional nuclear plants before moving ahead with new reactors - voted against the bill.  \\u201cSafely disposing of any radioactive material is a key priority of mine to ensure that we leave our environment pristine and unharmed for future generations,\\u201d Harris said, adding that she is willing to help improve the legislation. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'<s>The gay mafia has a new corporate  Don. This is the only article you will need to read about the sheer stupidity of left-wing agitators who are crowing about the new religious freedom law in Indiana.Yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook, himself a gay man, published an op-ed in The Washington Post with this ominous title:  Pro-discrimination laws are dangerous.  Cook argues that religious freedom laws, like the one signed by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana last week are  dangerous  to gay people.A debatable point. However, what is not debatable is this: laws that make homosexuality punishable by death are dangerous to gay people.That s why you might be surprised to learn that Cook s company, Apple, does business in four (4) countries that make homosexuality a capital crime. Those countries are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, and Qatar.If you zip on over to this page, you can see the list of all of the countries where Apple does business. Those four countries are on the list.We anxiously await CNN s Andrew Cuomo or ABC s George Stephanopoulos to ask Tim Cook to appear on air and explain this glaring inconsistency, which should be obvious even to the average MSNBC viewer.However, we all know that won t happen.Via: DownTrend</s>'"
